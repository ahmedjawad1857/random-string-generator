# Random String Generator

This is a simple Python script that generates a random string of specified length and copies it to the clipboard.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pyperclip module (`pip install pyperclip`)

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the length of the random string you want to generate when prompted.
3. The script will generate the random string, copy it to your clipboard, and print it to the console.
4. Paste the copied string anywhere you want.

## Example

Certainly! Here's the updated section:

```python
# Example output
"""
Enter the length of the string You want to generate...It automatically copied -> 10
xZyPqRwStU

copied to clipboard! paste it anywhere you want...
"""
```

This way, it will appear as a Python multi-line string comment, resembling the Python output format.

## Note

- This script is designed for fun and could be used to annoy individuals who send long random messages.
